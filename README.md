# Movie-app-project
Hello!
There are two ways to launch the app:
The first way is through the main menu, where there is a login and registration screen. To open a new user, you must enter registration. You can also log in through an existing user. The passwords for existing users are:
[{"username": "eran.json", "password": "Alphadog1"}, {"username": "liel.json", "password": "goodkid22"}, {"username": "movies.csv ", "password": "messi10"}, {"username": "yossi.csv", "password": "maccabi"}]
The second way is to enter command line arguments
which looks like this:
python movie_app.py and the name of the file in the terminal.
In the second way we will skip the main screen and enter the application.
